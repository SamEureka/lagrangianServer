## _Welcome to Lagrangian Station!_

I hope you enjoy this modpack! Use the quest book as a progression guide as you move through each mod tech tree. The quests are not comprehensive and only cover the basics of each installed mod. Of course you don't have to use the quest book at all... just play how you like. The goal is to get yourself back to Earth!

#### Where to start?

The quest book begins with the "Arrival" quests, getting you the basic tools needed to start out. While working on these quests it is a good idea to build yourself a safe base of operations and do some mining. Gathering some ore now might be tedious but it will make it easier to craft some of your early game items.

#### Do I have to do X?

Like I said above... you don't have to do anything you don't want to! This is Minecraft! Do what makes you happy. That being said... here is what I recommend.

1. Do the quests in order from top to bottom. I laid out the quests in order for each mod. So you will start with Tinkers Construct and then move into Immersive Engineering. The look and feel of these two mods is complimentary. The next two mods are Mekanism and Applied Energistics. These mods will take your technology advancement to the next level! Mekanism has a fun tech tree to work though with a lot of mining and ore manipulation automation machines. Applied Energistics is the pinnacle of storage mods! The end game for this modpack is Advanced Rocketry. This is a very complex and exciting mod that will challenge your Minecraft skills to the limit!
2. Use other resources to help you progress through the mods. If you are stuck... google it! There are a ton of play through tutorials on YouTube also. At the bottom this guide page I will link the best informational sites that I have found for each mod.
3. Have fun! Play with friends if you can. I am working to get a server download on the Lagrangian Station Curse page.
